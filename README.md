### Marvel App v1.2.1

Considerations:

- Some elements of the design where not specified or available to inspect, so I had to use my own criteria.
- Many data queries could not be performed properlly because the API didn't provide enough support. For example: a search by name is performed by exact **name** or **nameStartWith**.
- Some requirements were not clear, so I had to use my own criteria.
- In my opinion, the time to complete all features was not enough. Maybe, if I was more familiarized with technologies stack, I would be able to delivery on time.
- M-001 was the first story, and on the first PR I described all merging process.

This version is missing the following requirements:

- Favorites filter: I would implement it with Context API, storing favorits elements by id.
- Unit test: I would implement unit test with Jest, covering all the main components and running them before each commit.
- URL searching: I would implement it, detecting URL on search bar and use it to set parameters to call API.
- Query string: The browser URL detects and filters only by one character, not many. And when you search by one character and one comic, shows the detail of the first comic that API found with that name.
- Issue number: that one could't be include on the query, because "#" is used for internal elements reference by id.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
